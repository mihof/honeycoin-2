# Honeycoin

#### Michael Hofmann

Honeycoin is a site to play around with blockchains and cryptocurrency. Without logging in or signing up, you can see the blocks currently in the chain. If you sign up/login you can make transactions and mine blocks (for a reward). Every user is given a wallet with a base of 1000 currency to play with. On the blocks page you can see the mined blocks with their hash's, last hash's, data, and who made the transaction. In the transaction pool you can see transaction blocks to mine, and on the transaction page you can make transactions and see who you previously made transactions with
